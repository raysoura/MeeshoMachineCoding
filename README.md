Design a Sprint planner (Similar to Jira). A Sprint planner is used to assign the task to the team member and check the progress of the project of each teammate which is assigned to him/her.

 

Sprint: This is a time period in which the company assigns a task to the employee/team to complete a set amount of work.

Task: This comes inside the sprint, where any new feature of the project is broken down into a task, which is assigned to the team member.

 

Functionalities of the Sprint Planner:

Users should be able to create any Sprint. Should be able to add any Task to the Sprint and remove from it.

Users should be able to create a Task of type Story, Feature, Bug. Each can have their own Status (TODO, INPROGRESS, DONE).

Users should be able to change the Status of a Task.

Show Tasks assigned to a User in the Sprint.

Get Delayed Tasks in the Sprint.

 

Constraints:

Users can have max 2 Tasks in INPROGRESS Status in a Sprint.

Sprint can have max 20 Tasks.

Following Status changes are allowed ( TODO -> INPROGRESS, INPROGRESS->TODO, INPROGRESS-> DONE).

 

Expectations:

1. Make sure that you have a working and demonstrable code

2. Make sure that the code is functionally correct 

3. Make sure that the code is readable and modular (Code quality)
